        <article><p>The shark is the largest fish in the sea and belongs to the Chondrichthyes class of fish. 
            They have been around for more than 300 million years and were around even before dinosaurs. 
            There are about 350 different types of sharks, but researchers think there are other sharks that haven't been discovered.

        <h1>Why are sharks unique?</h1>
          <p>Their ability to thermoregulate makes them more tolerant of cool water and allows their muscles to respond more quickly than their cold-blooded relatives.
               This is just one of traits that make sharks such a diverse and interesting group of animals.
